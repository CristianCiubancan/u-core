# Placeholder for Clothing Images

This file serves as a placeholder to ensure the clothing images directory exists in the repository.

To use the grid-based clothing selection system, you should add clothing preview images to this directory following the naming convention described in the README.md file.

Example image names:
- male_11_0_0.png (Male tops, drawable 0, texture 0)
- female_4_1_2.png (Female legs, drawable 1, texture 2)

If no images are available, the system will display the drawable ID as a fallback.
